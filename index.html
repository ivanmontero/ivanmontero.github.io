      <h2>Hi!</h2>
      I'm Ivan Montero, a wannabe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#:~:text=Renaissance%20man%5Bedit%5D"><u>Renaissance man</u></a>.<br/><br/>
      
      Currently, I'm computer science Master's student at the University of Washington, where I do research in <a href=https://noahs-ark.github.io/><u>Noah's ARK</u></a> to help computers efficiently learn from language. I've also done natural language processing and computer vision research at Apple, Google, and Facebook. More detailed information can be found on my <a href="/pdf/cv.pdf">curriculum vitae</a>.<br/><br/>

      I enjoy dogs, philosophy, learning new languages, taking things apart, traveling, photography/videography, running, longboarding, swimming, drones, surfing, ... <br/><br/>

      <i><b>I am currently applying to PhD programs!</b></i><br><br>
